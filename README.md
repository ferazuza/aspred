# Setting up credentials 
In order to run the application, you need to set up your credentials. We provide an example credentials file named 'credentials.example.yaml' located in the 'notebooks' folder.

Follow these steps to set up your credentials:

1. Navigate to the 'notebooks' folder.
2. Make a copy of the 'credentials.example.yaml' file and rename it to 'credentials.yaml'.
3. Open 'credentials.yaml' in a text editor.
4. Fill in the required parameters with your credentials.

Please ensure that you do not commit the 'credentials.yaml' file to your version control system to keep your credentials secure.
